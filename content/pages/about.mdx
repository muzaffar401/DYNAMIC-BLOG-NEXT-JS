Creating has been my passion for as long as I've been dreaming. My first invention was a contraption made of legos and string at the age of 7, right after I engineered a way to get cookies from the top shelf without climbing.

What captured my heart more than playtime inventions was the vastness of the ocean. At 9, I built a mini-submarine out of old soda bottles and waterproofed boxes in my backyard pool, holding my breath and diving deep, imagining discovering new marine life.

My childhood was a tapestry of engineering marvels and aquatic adventures. Despite a few mishaps and soaked notebooks, by 16, I had designed a robotic fish that could map ocean floors. I remember the thrill of watching it glide through the water, sending back images to my homemade computer setup.

Now, I'm the mind behind AquaInnovate, where we're crafting underwater drones and modular research labs for ocean exploration. We're enabling marine enthusiasts to explore the depths from their docks, believing that the mysteries of the deep blue are just a dive away.
